You need to create an interface that allows the following sequence of actions:

- Transform the current system time into a string (time -> string).
- Save this transformed string to a database.
- Send this transformed string to another system.


Based on the client’s business requirements, there are currently two types of transformations needed:
1. Convert the current system time into the string "Before/After noon" (now -> "Before noon"; now -> "After noon").
2. Convert the current system time into a string with the format "dd.MM.yyyy" (now -> "dd.MM.yyyy").


It’s expected that in the future, new requirements will be added.
This means new algorithms will be needed to transform the current system time into different strings.
However, we don’t yet know what those requirements will be.


Your task is to create a function that transforms the current system time into a string.
After that, the transformed string should be saved to a database and sent to an external system.

The function must be callable from the FooController.

In this task, you can use the current system time. If a time zone is needed, assume it will always be UTC.

You cannot edit the pom.xml file, so you must work with the dependencies that are already available.

You are not allowed to edit the following classes: Foo, FooId, FooMockConfiguration, FooRepository, and ExternalSystemAdapter
